# Portable Headlight
Arduino code for a portable lighting device I made.

The device features an array of cool white LEDs and warm white LEDs, which are very bright when all lit together, and 2 control buttons.

## Controls

### Left button

The left button controls which value the right button changes and how it changes it.

- Press to toggle between increasing or decreasing a value
- Hold for half a second to toggle between changing brightness or color temperature
- Hold for 2 seconds to reset to full brightness and default color temperature

### Right button

The right button controls a value set by the left button. It will either increase or decrease that value, again set by the left button.

You can press and release to adjust in small steps, or press and hold to adjust faster.
